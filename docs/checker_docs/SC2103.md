# Use a ( subshell ) to avoid having to cd back.

### Problematic code:

```sh
for dir in */
do
  cd "$dir"
  convert index.png index.jpg
  cd ..
done
```


### Correct code:

```sh
for dir in */
do
  (
  cd "$dir" || exit
  convert index.png index.jpg
  )
done
```

or

```sh
for dir in */
do
  cd "$dir" || exit
  convert index.png index.jpg
  cd ..
done
```

### Rationale:

When doing `cd dir; somestuff; cd ..`, `cd dir` can fail when permissions are lacking, if the dir was deleted, or if `dir` is actually a file.

In this case, `somestuff` will run in the wrong directory and `cd ..` will take you to an even more wrong directory. In a loop, this will likely cause the next `cd` to fail as well, propagating this error and running these commands far away from the intended directories.

Check `cd`s exit status and/or use subshells to limit the effects of `cd`.

### Exceptions

If you set variables you can't use a subshell. In that case, you should definitely check the exit status of `cd`, which will also silence this suggestion.
