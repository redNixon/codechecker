## You need a space before the !.

### Problematic code:

```sh
while! [ -f file ]
do sleep 1; done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
while ! [ -f file ]
do sleep 1; done
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a keyword immediately followed by a `!`. There needs to be a space between them.

### Exceptions:

None
