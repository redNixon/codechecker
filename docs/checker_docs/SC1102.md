## Shells disambiguate $(( differently or not at all. If the first $( should start command substitution, add a space after it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo "$((cmd "$@") 2>&1)"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo "$( (cmd "$@") 2>&1)"
```
### Rationale:

You appear to be using `$((` with two (or more) parentheses in a row, where the first `$(` should open a subshell. 

This is an ill-defined structure that is parsed differently between different shells and shell versions. Prefer adding spaces to make it unambiguous, both to shells and humans.

Consider the `$(((` in `$(((1)) )`:

Ash, dash and Bash 1 parses it as `$(( (` and subsequently fail to find the matching `))`. Zsh and Bash 2+ looks ahead and parses it as `$( ((`. Ksh parses it as `$( ( (`. 

### Exceptions:

**Alternatively**, you may indeed have correctly spaced your parentheses, but ShellCheck failed to parse `$((` as an arithmetic expression while accidentally succeeding in parsing it as `$(` + `(`. 

In these cases, double check the syntax to ensure ShellCheck can parse the `$((`, or ignore this error and hope that it won't affect analysis too severely.
