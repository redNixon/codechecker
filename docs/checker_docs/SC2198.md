## Arrays don't work as operands in [ ]. Use a loop (or concatenate with * instead of @).

### Problematic code:

```sh
ext=png
allowedExt=(jpg bmp png)
[ "$ext" = "${allowedExt[@]}" ] && echo "Extension is valid"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
ext=png
allowedExt=(jpg bmp png)
for value in "${allowedExt[@]}"
do
  [ "$ext" = "$value" ] && echo "Extension is valid"
done
```
### Rationale:

Array expansions become a series of words in `[ .. ]`. Operators expect single words only.

The problematic code is equivalent to `[ "$ext" = jpg bmp png ]`, which is invalid syntax. A typical error message is `bash: [: too many arguments` or `dash: somefile: unexpected operator`. 

Instead, use a `for` loop to iterate over values, and apply your condition to each.

Alternatively, if you want to concatenate all the values in the array into a single string for your test, use `"$*"` or `"${array[*]}"`.

### Exceptions:

If you are dynamically building an a test expression, make your array the only thing in the test expression. ShellCheck will not emit a warning for: `set -- 1 -lt 2; [ "$@" ]`
