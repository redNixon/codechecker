## You need a space before the [.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if[ -e file ]
then echo "exists"; fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ -e file ]
then echo "exists"; fi
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a keyword immediately followed by a `[`. There needs to be a space between them.

### Exceptions:

None
