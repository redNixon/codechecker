## In dash, [\[ ]] is not supported.

You are writing a script for `dash`, but you're using a feature that `dash` doesn't support (in this case, bash/ksh style `[[ .. ]]` conditions). 

See Ubuntu's [DashAsBinSh](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh) migration guide for how to make bash-specific scripts dash-compatible.
