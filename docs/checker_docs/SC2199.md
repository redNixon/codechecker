## Arrays implicitly concatenate in `[[ ]]`. Use a loop (or explicit * instead of @).
### Problematic code:

```sh
ext=png
allowedExt=(jpg bmp png)
[[ "$ext" = "${allowedExt[@]}" ]] && echo "Extension is valid"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
ext=png
allowedExt=(jpg bmp png)
for value in "${allowedExt[@]}"
do
  [[ "$ext" = "$value" ]] && echo "Extension is valid"
done
```
### Rationale:

Array expansions in `[[ .. ]]` will implicitly concatenate into a single string, much like in assignments. The problematic code is equivalent to `[ "$ext" = "jpg bmp png" ]`. 

Instead, use a `for` loop to iterate over values, and apply your condition to each.

Alternatively, if you do want to concatenate all the values in the array into a single string for your test, use `"$*"` or `"${array[*]}"` to make this explicit.

### Exceptions:

None.
