## Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?.

### Problematic code:

```sh
make mytarget

if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
  echo "Build failed"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if ! make mytarget
then
  echo "Build failed"
fi
```
### Rationale:

Running a command and then checking its exit status `$?` against 0 is redundant.

Instead of just checking the exit code of a command, it checks the exit code of a command (e.g. `[`) that checks the exit code of a command.

Apart from the redundancy, there are other reasons to avoid this pattern:

* Since the command and its status test are decoupled, inserting an innocent command like `echo "make finished"` after `make` will cause the `if` statement to silently start comparing `echo`'s status instead.
* Scripts that run or are called with `set -e ` aka `errexit` will exit immediately if the command fails, even though they're followed by a clause that handles failure. 
* The value of `$?` is overwritten by `[`/`[[`, so you can't get the original value in the relevant then/else block (e.g. `if mycmd; then echo "Success"; else echo "Failed with $?"; fi`).

To check that a command returns success, use `if mycommand; then ...`.

To check that a command returns failure, use `if ! mycommand; then ...`. Notice that `!` will overwrite `$?` value.

To additionally capture output with command substitution: `if output=$(mycommand); then ...`

This also applies to `while`/`until` loops.

### Exceptions:

The default Solaris 10 bourne shell does not support '!' outside of the test command (`if ! mycommand; then ...` returns `!: not found`)
