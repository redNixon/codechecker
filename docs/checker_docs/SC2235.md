## Use `{ ..; }` instead of `(..)` to avoid subshell overhead.

### Problematic code:

```sh
([ "$x" ] || [ "$y" ]) && [ "$z" ]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
{ [ "$x" ] || [ "$y" ]; } && [ "$z" ]
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be using `(..)` to group test commands. This creates a subshell, making it unnecessarily slow. Avoid this by using `{ ..; }` to group.

Be careful to note that unlike `(..)`, this requires both a space after the `{` and a semicolon before the `}`.

For example, `(cmd)`, `(cmd;)` and `( cmd )` are all valid, but `{cmd}`, `{cmd;}` and `{ cmd }` are all syntax errors because they lack either or both of the spaces and semicolon. The correct form is `{ cmd; }`

Here's a small benchmark showing that the subshell version is more than 100x slower:

```
$ i=0; time for i in {1..10000}; do ([ "$x" ] || [ "$y" ]) && [ "$z" ]; done
real    0m7.122s
user    0m4.204s
sys     0m2.825s

$ i=0; time for i in {1..10000}; do { [ "$x" ] || [ "$y" ]; } && [ "$z" ]; done
real    0m0.055s
user    0m0.055s
sys     0m0.000s
```
