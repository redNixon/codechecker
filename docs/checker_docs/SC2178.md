## Variable was used as an array but is now assigned a string.

### Problematic code:

```sh
flags[0]="-r"
flags[1]="--delete-after"

if [ "$dryrun" ]
then
   flags="--dry-run"
fi

```

### Correct code:

```sh
flags[0]="-r"
flags[1]="--delete-after"

if [ "$dryrun" ]
then
   flags=( "--dry-run" )
fi
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck noticed that you have used a variable as an array, but then assign it a string. `array=foo` is equivalent to `array[0]=foo`, and leaves the rest of the elements unaffected.

In the incorrect code, `"${flags[@]}"` would contain `--dry-run` `--delete-after`.

To set an array to only a single, given element, you should use `array=( foo )`.

In the correct code, `"${flags[@]}"` will contain `--dry-run` only. 

Another possible cause is accidentally missing the `$` on a previous assignment: `var=(my command); var=bar` instead of `var=$(my command); var=bar`. If the variable is not intended to be an array, ensure that it's never assigned as one.

### Exceptions:

ShellCheck can get confused by variable scope if the same variable name was used as an array previously, but is a string in the current context. You can [[ignore]] it in this case.
