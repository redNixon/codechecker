## If you wanted to assign the output of the pipeline, use a=$(b | c) .

### Problematic code:

```sh
sum=find | wc -l
```

### Correct code:

```sh
sum=$(find | wc -l)
```

### Rationale:

The intention in this code was that `sum` would in some way get the value of the command `find | wc -l`.

However, `|` has precedence over the `=`, so the command is a two stage pipeline consisting of `sum=find` and `wc -l`.

`sum=find` is a plain string assignment. Since it happens by itself in an independent pipeline stage, it has no effect: it produces no output, and the variable disappears when the pipeline stage finishes. Because the assignment produces no output, `wc -l` will count 0 lines.

To instead actually assign a variable with the output of a command, command substitution `$(..)` can be used.

### Exceptions:

None. This warning is triggered whenever the first stage of a pipeline is a single assignment, which is never correct.
