## Consider using grep -c instead of grep|wc.

### Problematic code:

```sh
grep foo | wc -l
```

### Correct code:

```sh
grep -c foo
```

### Rationale:

This is purely a stylistic issue. `grep` can count lines without piping to `wc`.

Note that in many cases, this number is only used to see whether there are matches (i.e. `== 0`). In these cases, it's better and more efficient to use `grep -q` and check its exit status:

```sh
if grep -q pattern file
then
  echo "The file contains the pattern"
fi
```

Also note that in `foo | grep bar | wc -l`, wc will mask the exit code of grep by default (i.e. without `set -o pipefail`), and always return success. If replacing with `foo | grep -c bar`, grep will exit non-zero when the count is 0. This is convenient for conditional statements but may require handling when used with `set -e`.

### Exceptions

If you e.g. want to count characters instead of lines, and you actually care about the number and not just whether it's greater than 0, you can [[ignore]] this error.
