## Was this intended as a comment? Use `#` in sh.

### Problematic code:

```C
// This is a comment.
/* This too. */
```

### Correct code:

```sh
# This is a comment.
# This too.
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found what appears to be a C-style comment, a line starting with `//` or `/*`.

In Bourne based shell scripts, the comment character is `#`

### Exceptions:

None.
