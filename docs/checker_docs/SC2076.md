## Don't quote rhs of =~, it'll match literally rather than as a regex.

### Problematic code:

```sh
[[ $foo =~ "^fo+ bar$" ]]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[[ $foo =~ ^fo+\ bar$ ]]
```

### Rationale:

Quotes on the right hand side of `=~` can be used to match literally, so that `[[ $1 =~ ^"$2".* ]]` works even if `$2` contains regex metacharacters. This mirrors the behavior of globs, `[[ $1 = "$2"* ]]`.

This also means that the problematic code tries to match literal carets and plus signs instead of interpreting them as regular expression matchers.  To match as a regex, the regex metacharacters it must be unquoted. Literal parts of the expression can be quoted with double or single quotes, or escaped.

### Exceptions:

If you do want to match literally just to do a plain substring search, e.g. `[[ $foo =~ "bar" ]]`, you could ignore this message, but consider using a more canonical glob match instead: `[[ $foo = *"bar"* ]]`.

### Compatibility:

* In Bash 3.2 and newer with shopt `compat31` *disabled (the default)*, quoted patterns are literal whereas unquoted patterns are parsed for regex metacharacters.
* In Bash 3.2 and newer with shopt `compat31` *enabled*, quoted and unquoted patterns match identically.
* In Bash 3.1 quoted and unquoted patterns match identically.
