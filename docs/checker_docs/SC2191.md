## The = here is literal. To assign by index, use ( [index]=value ) with no spaces. To keep as literal, quote it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
array=( [index] = value )
```

### Correct code:

```sh
array=( [index]=value )
```

### Rationale:

The shell doesn't care about the `=` sign in your array assignment because it's not part of a recognized index assignment. Instead, it's considered a literal character and becomes part of an array element's value.

In the example problematic code, this is because the `=` was intended to set the index, but the shell will not recognize it when it is surrounded by spaces.

Make sure to remove any spaces around the `=` when assigning by index, such as in the correct code.

If you wanted the `=` to be a literal part of the array element, add quotes around it, such as `env=( "LC_CTYPE=C" )` or `specialChars=( "=" "%" ";" )` .

### Exceptions:

None.
