## Semicolons directly after 'then' are not allowed. Just remove it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if true; then; echo "Hi"; fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if true; then echo "Hi"; fi
```
### Rationale:

`then` keywords should not be followed by semicolons. It's not valid shell syntax.

You can follow them directly with a line break or another command.

### Exceptions:

None
