## Expected a { to open the function definition.

### Problematic code:

```sh
foo() {
  echo "hello world"
}
foo()
```

### Correct code:

```sh
foo() {
  echo "hello world"
}
foo
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found what appears to be the start of a function definition, but without a function body.

One common cause is that you are trying to call a function by appending parentheses, e.g. `foo()` like in C. Bash does not use or allow parentheses after a function name to call it. The function `foo` should be called using just `foo` like in the example. 

If you are declaring a function, make sure it looks like the correct code above, and that it does not try to declare any parameters (parameters are instead accessed with `$1` and up). 

If you are trying to do something else, look up the syntax for what you are trying to do.


### Exceptions:

POSIX allows the body of a function to be any compound command, e.g. `foo() for i; do :; done`. Since this usage is rare, ShellCheck requires the body to be {} (or ()). This additional structure requirement helps improve error messages and suggestions by not parsing down a path that less advanced users wouldn't expect.
