# Use `$(...)` notation instead of legacy backticked `` `...` ``.

### Problematic code

```sh
echo "Current time: `date`"
```

### Correct code

```sh
echo "Current time: $(date)"
```

### Rationale

Backtick command substitution `` `...` `` is legacy syntax with several issues.

1. It has a series of undefined behaviors related to quoting in POSIX.
1. It imposes a custom escaping mode with surprising results.
1. It's exceptionally hard to nest.

`$(...)` command substitution has none of these problems, and is therefore strongly encouraged.

### Exceptions

None.
