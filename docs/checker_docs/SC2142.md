## Aliases can't use positional parameters. Use a function.

### Problematic code:

```sh
alias archive='mv "$@" /backup'
```

### Correct code:

```sh
archive() { mv "$@" /backup; }

```

### Rationale:

Aliases just substitute the start of a command with something else. They therefore can't use positional parameters, such as `$1`. Rewrite your alias as a function.

### Exceptions

If your alias ends up quoting the value, e.g. `alias cut_first="awk '{print \$1}'"`, you can technically [[ignore]] this error. However, you should consider turning this alias into a more readable function instead: `cut_first() { awk '{print $1}' "$@"; }`

You can also [[ignore]] this warning if you intentionally referenced the positional parameters of its relevant context, knowing that it won't refer to the parameters of the alias itself. For example, `alias whatisthis='echo "This is $0 -$-" #'` will show the shell name with flags, i.e. `This is dash -smi` or `This is bash -himBs`, and is correct usage because it does not intend for `$0` to reflect anything related to the `whatisthis` alias or its invocation.
