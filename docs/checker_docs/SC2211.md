## This is a glob used as a command name. Was it supposed to be in ${..}, array, or is it missing quoting?

### Problematic code:

```sh
for f in $(*.png); do echo "$f"; done   # Trying to loop over a glob
array=$(*.txt)                          # Trying to assign an array
echo "$(array[1])"                      # Trying to expand an array
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for f in *.png; do echo "$f"; done
array=(*.txt)
echo "${array[1]}"
```

### Rationale:

You are using a glob as a command name. This is usually a mistake caused by one of the following:

* Trying to use `` `*foo*` `` or `$(*foo*)` to expand a glob. 
* Using `var=$(*.txt)` instead of `var=(*.txt)` to assign an array.
* Using `$(..)` instead of `${..}` when expanding an array element.
* Running a program with a name or directory that contains glob characters without escaping them.

Look up and double check the syntax of what you're trying to do.

### Exceptions:

None. If you want to specify a command name via glob, e.g. to not hard code version in `./myprogram-*/foo`, expand to array or parameters first to allow handling the cases of 0 or 2+ matches.
