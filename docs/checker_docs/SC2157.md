## Argument to implicit -n is always true due to literal strings.
(Or: Argument to -z is always false due to literal strings. )

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ "$foo " ]
then
  echo "this is always true because of the trailing space"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ "$foo" ]
then
  echo "correctly checks value"
fi
```

### Rationale:

Since `[ str ]` and `[ -n str ]` check that the string is non-empty, any literal characters in the string -- including a space character like in the example -- will cause the test to always be true.

Equivalently, since `[ -z str ]` checks that the string is empty, any literal character in the string will cause the test to always be false.

Double check the string: you may have added trailing characters, or bad quotes or syntax. Some examples include:

* `[ "$foo " ]` like in the example, where the space becomes part of the string
* `[ "{$foo}" ]` instead of `[ "${foo}" ]`, where the `{` becomes part of the string
* `[ "$foo -gt 0" ]` instead of `[ "$foo" -gt "0" ]`, where the `-gt` becomes part of the string


### Exceptions:

None.
