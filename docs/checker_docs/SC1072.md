# Unexpected ..

*Note: There is a [known bug](../issues/1036) in the current version when [directives](../wiki/Directive) appear within `then` clauses of `if` blocks that causes Shellcheck to report SC1072 on otherwise valid code. Avoid using directives within `then` clauses - instead place them at the top of the `if` block or another enclosing block. This is fixed on the [online version](https://www.shellcheck.net/) and the next release.*
