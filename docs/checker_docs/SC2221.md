## This pattern always overrides a later one.

### Problematic code:

```sh
case "$1" in
  -?) echo "Usage: $0 [-n]";;
  -n) echo "Hello World";;
   *) exit 1;;
esac
```

### Correct code:

```sh
case "$1" in
  -\?) echo "Usage: $0 [-n]";;
  -n) echo "Hello World";;
   *) exit 1;;
esac
```
### Rationale:

You have specified multiple patterns in a `case` statement, where one will always override the other. The pattern being overridden is indicated with a [[SC2222]] warning.

In the example, `-?` actually matches a dash followed by any character, such as `-n`. This means that the later `-n` branch will never trigger. In this case, the correct solution is to escape the `-\?` so that it doesn't match `-n`. 

Another common reason for this is accidentally duplicating a branch. In this case, fix or delete the duplicate branch.

### Exceptions:

None. One could argue that having `-*|--*) echo "Invalid flag";` is a readability issue, even though the second pattern follows from the first. In this case, you can either rearrange the pattern from most to least specific, i.e. `--*|-*)` or ignore the error.

When ignoring this error, remember that ShellCheck directives have to go in front of the `case` statement, and not in front of the branch:

    # shellcheck disable=SC2221,SC2222
    case "$1" in
      -n) ...;;
      # no directive here
      -*|--*) echo "Unknown flag" ;;
    esac
