## Redirection applies to the find command itself. Rewrite to work per action (or move to end).

### Problematic code:

```sh
find . -name '*.ppm' -exec pnmtopng {} > {}.png \;
```

### Correct code:

```sh
find . -name '*.ppm' -exec sh -c 'pnmtopng "$1" > "$1.png"' _ {} \;
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck detected a `find` command with a redirection in the middle.

This redirection may have been intended to apply only to a specific action like `-exec` or `-print`, but it does in fact apply to the entire `find` command:

    # This command
    find . -name '*.ppm' -exec pnmtopng {} > {}.png \;

    # Is the same as this
    {
       find . -name '*.ppm' -exec pnmtopng {} \;
    } > {}.png 

To perform a redirection per action, rewrite it with e.g. `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} \;` 

If the redirection is something like `> /dev/null` where you don't mind it applying to the whole `find` and not individual results, move the redirection to the end of command:

    find . -exec foo {} > /dev/null \;     # Ambiguous syntax. Is it per -exec or not?
    find . -exec foo {} \;  > /dev/null    # Identical command with clear intent.
