## Globs don't work as operands in [ ]. Use a loop.

### Problematic code:

```sh
[ current.log -nt backup/*.log ] && echo "This is the latest file"

```

### Correct code:

```sh
newerThanAll=true
for log in backup/*.log
do
  [ current.log -nt "$log" ] || newerThanAll=false
done
[ "$newerThanAll" = "true" ] && echo "This is the latest file"
```

### Rationale:

Globs in `[ ]` will expand to a sequence of words, one per matching filename. Meanwhile, operators work on single words.

The problematic code is equivalent to `[ current.log -nt backup/file1.log backup/file2.log backup/file3.log ]`, which is invalid syntax. A typical error message is `bash: [: too many arguments` or `dash: somefile: unexpected operator`. 

Instead, use a `for` loop to iterate over matching filenames, and apply your condition to each.

### Exceptions:

If you know your glob will only ever match one file, you can check this explicitly and use the first file:

```
set -- backup/*.log
[ $# -eq 1 ] || { echo "There are too many matches."; exit 1; }
[ file.log -nt "$1" ] && echo "This is the latest file"
```

Alternatively, [[ignore]] this warning.
