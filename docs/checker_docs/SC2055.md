## You probably wanted && here

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [[ $1 != foo || $1 != bar ]]
then
  echo "$1 is not foo or bar"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [[ $1 != foo && $1 != bar ]]
then
  echo "$1 is not foo or bar"
fi
```

### Rationale:

This is not a bash issue, but a simple, common logical mistake applicable to all languages.

`[[ $1 != foo || $1 != bar ]]` is always true (when `foo != bar`):

* If `$1 = foo` then `$1 != bar` is true, so the statement is true.
* If `$1 = bar` then `$1 != foo` is true, so the statement is true.
* If `$1 = cow` then `$1 != foo` is true, so the statement is true.

`[[ $1 != foo && $1 != bar ]]` matches when `$1` is neither `foo` nor `bar`:

* If `$1 = foo`, then `$1 != foo` is false, so the statement is false.
* If `$1 = bar`, then `$1 != bar` is false, so the statement is false.
* If `$1 = cow`, then both `$1 != foo` and `$1  != bar` is true, so the statement is true.

This statement is identical to `! [[ $1 = foo || $1 = bar ]]`, which also works correctly.

### Exceptions

Rare.
