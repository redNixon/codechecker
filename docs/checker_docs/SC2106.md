## SC2106: This only exits the subshell caused by the pipeline.

### Problematic code:

```sh
for i in a b c; do
  echo hi | grep -q bye | break
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for i in a b c; do
  echo hi | grep -q bye || break
done
```
### Rationale:

The most common cause of this issue is probably using a single `|` when `||` was intended.  The reason this message appears, though, is that a construction like this, intended to surface a failure inside of a loop:

```sh
for i in a b c; do false | break; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
```

may appear to work:
```
$ for i in a b c; do false | break; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
1 0
```

What's actually happening, though, becomes clear if we add some `echo`s; the entire loop completes, and the `break` has no effect.

```sh
$ for i in a b c; do echo $i; false | break; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
a
b
c
1 0
$ for i in a b c; do false | break; echo $i; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
a
b
c
0
```

Because bash processes pipelines by creating subshells, control statements like `break` only take effect in the subshell.
