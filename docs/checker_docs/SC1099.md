## You need a space before the #.

### Problematic code:

```sh
while sleep 1
do# show time
  date
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
while sleep 1
do # show time
  date
done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has noticed that you have a keyword immediately followed by a `#`. In order for the `#` to start a comment, it needs to come after a word boundary such as a space.

### Exceptions:

None.
