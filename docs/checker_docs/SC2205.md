## (..) is a subshell. Did you mean [ .. ], a test expression?

### Problematic code:

```sh
if ( 1 -lt 2 )
then
  echo "1 is less than 2"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ 1 -lt 2 ]
then
  echo "1 is less than 2"
fi
```
### Rationale:

Tests like `-eq` to check numeric equality or `\<` for string comparison only work are actually parameters to the `test` command, and only work as tests in that context. `[` is an alias for `test`, so you'll frequently see them written as `[ 1 -eq 2 ]`.

`( .. )` is completely unrelated, and is a subshell mostly used to scope shell modifications. They should not be used in `if` or `while` statements in shell scripts.

If you wanted to test a condition, rewrite the `( .. )` to `[ .. ]`. 

### Exceptions:

This error is triggered by having a binary operator as the first parameter in a subshell, and could falsely trigger on e.g. `if ( grep -eq "foo|bar" file )`. In these cases, check whether the subshell is actually needed.

Note that there's a similar looking error [[SC2204]] with a low false positive rate.
