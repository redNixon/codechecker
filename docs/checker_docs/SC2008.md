## echo doesn't read from stdin, are you sure you should be piping to it?

### Problematic code:

```sh
find . | echo
```

### Correct code:

```sh
find .
```

### Rationale:

You are piping command output to `echo`, but `echo` ignores all piped input.

In particular, `echo` is not responsible for putting output on screen. Commands already output data, and with no further actions that will end up on screen.

### Exceptions:

None.
