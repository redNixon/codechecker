## Can't use sudo with builtins like cd. Did you want sudo sh -c .. instead?

### Problematic code:

```sh
sudo cd /root
pwd
```

### Correct code:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'cd /root && pwd'
```
### Rationale:

Due to the Unix process model, `sudo` can only change the privileges of a new, external process. It can not grant privileges to a currently running process.

This means that shell builtins -- commands that are interpreted by the current shell rather than through program invocation -- cannot be run with `sudo`. This includes `cd`, `source`, `read`, and others.

Instead you can run a shell with `sudo`, and have that shell run the builtins you want. Just be aware that what happens in that shell stays in that shell:

    sudo sh -c 'cd /root && pwd'  # This shows /root
    pwd                           # This shows the original directory

### Exceptions:

None.
